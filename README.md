# `react-native-clone-project`

This module allows you to clone an existing project by creating a new project.

## Getting started

`npm install react-native-clone-project -g`

## Usage

`Execute on your terminal: react-native-clone-project clone`
`When you run the module, you fill in the name of the new project and the name of the package.
At the end of the execution, you will have a new project created.
Very useful for those who want to create a white label.

After finishing the cloning, perform a cache clean on the project and then run an npm run android / ios

Note: It is always good to be sure, the module is not 100% effective for all versions so always look for names of the old project in the new folder to make sure everything has been modified.`
